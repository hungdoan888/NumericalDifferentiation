# NumericalDifferentiation
- When calculating a derivative directly is not possible, or numerically cumbersome, it may be better to numerically approximate the derivative. We can do this by using a Taylor series to approximate the function. By rearranging the terms in the Taylor series, we are able to obtain a formula that approximates the error in the derivative of a function. In this case, we will be approximating f(x) = sin(x). After obtaining the error function, we can take the derivative of the function to find optimal solutions
of h, hopt which minimizes the error in our approximation of the derivative. In this project, I will be using h values h = 10^-i for i = 1, 2, ..., 16 to calculate the error in our approximation of the derivative. I will then compare the results to the optimal solution of h.
